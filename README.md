# Panel Local Projection
This is the repository for panel local projection to collaborate with

Ziwei Mei, Liugang Sheng, Zhentao Shi (2023), "[Implicit Nickell Bias in Panel Local Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13455)", _Working Paper_. 

It provides an `R` function to implement the panel local projection that includes two methods: 

- The _fixed effect_ (FE) estimator as a common practice that suffers Nickell bias, 
- The _half-panel jackknife_ (HJ) estimator without asymptotical bias.  



### Contents  

 `LP_panel.R` includes the main function `LP_panel()` with detailed instructions. 

`example.R` gives an example to demonstrate the usage of the function `LP_panel()`.
